Mathematica notebooks for the figures in [arXiv:2501.06134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06134): "Exact steady state of perturbed open quantum systems" by Omar Nagib and Thad G. Walker, which presents a nonperturbative method to efficiently find the steady steady of Markovian open quantum systems. 

We would appreciate citing the corresponding paper and the repository in case of using the work.
